Command Crossword Puzzle
========================

This assignment consists of creating a crossword puzzle that will help introduce commands that can be used in the terminal, i.e. echo, rm, make. The crossword puzzle must consist of at least 10 different commands. Each command should either have a description or example that will help lead to finding the correct answer. These should be made electronically. It is fine to use a crossword puzzle generator found online as long as you create the commands and questions yourself. These will be printed off and brought to the next class period. This will lead to the in class assignment part of this assignment that consists of filling out someone else's crossword puzzle. The in class assignment part will also be a part of your grade.
