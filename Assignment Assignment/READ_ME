1. Why is this assignment relevent to an Intro to Unix course?

This assignment is relevant to an Introduction to Unix course because it introduces the commands that can be used in the terminal. These commands are used all the time and are very useful. We did an assignment this year that consisted of learning five different commands and then we had to present them to the groups that were assignedto us. I feel that this does the same thing but in a more fun manner. It also allows people to get more experience with it in class instead of just listening to a group member explain it.

2. How should points be distributed for this assignment, i.e. what percentage should go to syntax, style, functionality, content, etc. If the solution fails to work at all (fails to compile, or fails to run) how should it be evaluated?

10 points should go to whether or not 10 commands were used in the crossword puzzle, 10 points should go to how well the questions/descriptions were written, and 10 points should go to whether or not the person participated in the in class part of the assignment.
